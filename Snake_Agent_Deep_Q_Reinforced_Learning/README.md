##  [Python + PyTorch + Pygame Reinforcement Learning â€“ Train an AI to Play Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds)

This video shows how to train an AI to play Snake using Python, PyTorch, and Pygame. The video is divided into four parts:

* **Part 1: Basics of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning**
* **Part 2: Setup environment and implement snake game**
* **Part 3: Implement agent to control game**
* **Part 4: Create and train neural network**

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that teaches an agent to take actions in an environment in order to maximize a reward. In this video, we will train an AI to play Snake using Deep Q Learning, which is a type of reinforcement learning that uses a neural network to learn the value of different actions.

## Environment Setup

The first step is to set up the environment. This includes creating the game board, snake, and food. We will use Pygame to create the graphics for the game.

## Implementing the Snake Game

Once the environment is set up, we need to implement the snake game. This includes handling user input, updating the game state, and checking for collisions.

## Implementing the Agent

The next step is to implement the agent. The agent will use the Deep Q Learning algorithm to learn the value of different actions. This will allow the agent to choose the best action to take in any given situation.

## Creating and Training the Neural Network

Finally, we need to create and train the neural network. The neural network will be used by the Deep Q Learning algorithm to learn the value of different actions. The training process will involve playing the game many times and updating the neural network's weights based on the outcome of each game.

## Results

Once the neural network is trained, we can test it by playing the game against itself. The AI should be able to learn to play the game and earn high scores.

## Conclusion

This video provides a comprehensive introduction to reinforcement learning and Deep Q Learning. It also shows how to train an AI to play Snake using these techniques. If you are interested in learning more about reinforcement learning or Deep Q Learning, I encourage you to watch this video.
