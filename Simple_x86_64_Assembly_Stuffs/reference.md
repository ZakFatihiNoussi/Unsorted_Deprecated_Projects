# The following assembly code was sourced from [Gaultier's Blog](https://gaultier.github.io/blog/x11_x64.html)



## Section Declarations

```assembly
BITS 64
CPU X64
section .rodata
```

These lines set the architecture to 64-bit and declare a read-only data section.

## Constants

```assembly
%define AF_UNIX 1
%define SOCK_STREAM 1
%define SYSCALL_SOCKET 41
%define SYSCALL_EXIT 60
%define SYSCALL_WRITE 1
%define STDOUT 1
%define SYSCALL_CONNECT 42
```

These lines define constants for various socket-related system calls and file descriptors.

## Data Section

```assembly
section .rodata
sun_path: db "/tmp/.X11-unix/X0", 0
```

This section defines a null-terminated string (`sun_path`) containing the path "/tmp/.X11-unix/X0."

## Function: x11_connect_to_server

```assembly
x11_connect_to_server:
```

This function establishes a connection to an X11 server using a Unix domain socket.

- It opens a Unix socket using the `socket` system call.
- Copies the socket file descriptor to `rdi`.
- Sets up the sockaddr_un structure on the stack.
- Connects to the server using the `connect` system call.
- Returns the socket file descriptor.

## Function: print_zak

```assembly
print_zak:
```

This function prints the string "zak" to the standard output.

- Allocates space on the stack for the string.
- Stores each character of the string in consecutive bytes on the stack.
- Uses the `write` system call to print the string.
- Deallocates the stack space used for the string.

## Function: print_hello

```assembly
print_hello:
```

This function prints the string "hello" followed by a call to `print_zak`.

- Allocates space on the stack for the "hello" string.
- Stores each character of the string on the stack.
- Uses the `write` system call to print the string.
- Calls `print_zak`.
- Deallocates the stack space used for the "hello" string.

## Entry Point: _start

```assembly
global _start
_start:
```

This is the entry point of the program.

- Initializes `rax` to zero.
- Calls the `exit` system call, terminating the program.

# Summary

The assembly code establishes a connection to an X11 server using a Unix domain socket and defines functions to print "zak" and "hello" to the standard output. The program then exits. The `print_hello` function demonstrates calling another function (`print_zak`) within the assembly code. The program primarily uses system calls for I/O operations and socket communication.
